## Introduction
Hey there! I'm Harry, your not-so-average software whisperer and machine learning magician, currently playing dress-up with algorithms at Revery AI - think of it as a high-tech version of playing with dolls, but cooler and in the Bay Area. My tech journey began in the depths of China National Petroleum Corporation, where I mixed predictive analytics with a sprinkle of wizardry to predict... well, things better than before. Then I dove headfirst into the wild world of cybersecurity at Boston University, where I was basically a digital Sherlock Holmes, but with more coffee and less deerstalker hat.

Educated as a master in Computer Science, my spellbook includes Java, Python, and the dark arts of Spring Boot, not to mention my secret weapon: an uncanny ability to talk to databases (MySQL whispers sweet nothings in my ear).

When I’m not conjuring code or battling bugs in the digital realm, you can find me on a quest for the perfect user experience, because let’s face it, everyone deserves a bit of magic in their lives. Dive into my world at haorandai.com, where technology meets fun, and where I try my best to convince you that I’m as cool online as I am in person. Spoiler: I’m cooler.
